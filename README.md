> Froggi 1.0 is no longer maintained in favor of Froggi 2.0, it features a complete frontend/backend rewrite and is released under the MIT license. Use older versions with caution, as they may not follow modern security practices. This software is provided 'as is,' and by using Froggi 1.0, you accept the associated risks.

# Usage
When you run the binary for the first time it should generate all the files and folders it needs  
Here is what each of those files/folders do.
 - sponsors (folder): any png file you put in here will be cycled every 5 seconds if you press the show sponsors button on the dashboard or countdown page, note it will only load these on app startup
 - teams (folder): this folder contains the images, names, and jersey colors of all team presets you set
 - login (folder): this folder is not for manual editing and contains login information
 - config.cfg (file): this file is where you can set the address the server listens on and the background color of the overlay page in RGB format

When logging into the web interface for the first time you will be prompted to create a login for the web interface.  
After creating a login simply sign in, upload team presets, and start streaming!

# Installation
- NOTICE: froggi in the future will be using docker, and precompiled binaries will no longer be available so if for any reason you prefer to use binaries please compile it yourself  
- Pre-compiled binaries will be under [releases](https://github.com/AllLiver/FOSSO/releases "releases")  
- If your platform does not have a pre-compiled binary please follow the instructions to [compile](https://github.com/AllLiver/FOSSO?tab=readme-ov-file#compilation "how to compile") repository yourself
- If using precompiled Windows build, it is crucial that quick edit mode is turned off on Command Prompt

# Compilation 
- Download the source code from the latest [release](https://github.com/AllLiver/FOSSO/releases "releases") (usually main branch is not stable)
- Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/ "rustup") if you do not have it installed
- Make sure you have basic C build tools (Windows and MacOS usually have them pre-installed)
- Run this command in the same directory as the cloned repository
```
cargo build --release
```
The compiled binary will be in /target/release

# Roadmap
Froggi is an indev project so change is very likely.
Here are some features/updates planned
 - Docker support for the stable channel
 - Consistent naming in API and frontend code
 - Web-accessible logs
 - Improved HTML chips for downs & home scoring
 - Integration with OCR (MIT) [https://github.com/RenarsKokins/ScoreboardOCR](https://github.com/occ-ai/scoresight)

# Tech Stack
 - Rust with Axum in the backend
 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the HTMX library for the frontend
